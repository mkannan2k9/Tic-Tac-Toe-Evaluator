# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Probability Predictor

This Python program implements a tic-tac-toe AI that predicts optimal moves using minimax and estimates the probabilities of X win, O win, and draw outcomes from any board state using Monte Carlo simulation.

## Features

- Optimal move prediction with minimax algorithm
- Empirical win/draw probability calculation using random playouts
- Customizable starting board and simulation count

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the script.  
You can modify the starting board in the `__main__` section.  
The program prints the estimated probabilities for X win, O win, and draw based on random simulations.

## Requirements

- Python 3
